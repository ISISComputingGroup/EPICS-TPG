#How TPG300 comms work:
#First send a command (e.g. ask for the pressure) then the device will return ACK.
#Then send ENQ to get the actual value.

#According to the streamdevice manual, once an "out" is sent access to the
#device is exclusively locked until the WHOLE protocol is finished.
#This should mean that we do not need to worry about commands interrupting each other
