#How TPG26x comms work:
#First send a command (e.g. ask for the pressure) then the device will return ACK.
#Then send ENQ to get the actual values.

#According to the streamdevice manual, once an "out" is sent access to the
#device is exclusively locked until the WHOLE protocol is finished.
#This should mean that we do not need to worry about commands interrupting each other

# Get pressures (and errors) from both guages

# in "%(\$1\$2)d,%f,%(\$1\$3)d,%(\$1\$4)f\r";
# in "%d,%f,%d,%f\r";
# in "%(\$1\$2)d,%f\r";

# Get the current units
